🚀 Forge2 Development Roadmap
✅ Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Completed / In Progress)
 Project structure (Monorepo with React/Next.js + Express API)

 Basic UI with Tailwind + OpenAI design language

 Blockchain integration base (Solana + EVM RPC endpoints)

 Wallet connection & signature flow (Phantom, MetaMask)

 GitHub repo public and structured

🔧 Phase 1: MVP Core Features (Now → ~1–2 Weeks)
Goal: Allow users to fully deploy tokens with basic configuration across supported chains.

Frontend

 Launch Wizard UI (multi-step)

 Chain selector (Solana, Base, Avalanche)

 Token config: name, ticker, supply, decimals

 Deploy summary & confirmation modal

Smart Contracts

 EVM ERC20 deployer (configurable tax, burn)

 Solana SPL deployer (Anchor-based)

 LP Locking contract (EVM + placeholder for Solana)

 Presale escrow contract (EVM, optional)

Backend / API

 API endpoints to initiate token creation and monitor status

 Store deployments for dashboard

 Chain abstraction (multi-chain support via Axelar/LayerZero)

🧪 Phase 2: Testing & DevOps (Parallel Tasking)
Goal: Harden backend/smart contracts and test cross-chain deployment flows

 Local + testnet testing (Base Goerli, Fuji, Solana devnet)

 Unit + integration tests (contracts + endpoints)

 Contract audits (internal / automated)

 Setup CI/CD pipelines for smart contract deployment + web

📈 Phase 3: Advanced Tokenomics + Analytics (~2 Weeks)
Goal: Provide full control over token behavior and show real-time data

Tokenomics UI

 Burn % / Tx tax / lock durations

 Gated presale options (whitelist, cap)

 Audit badge integration (via API or schema flag)

Analytics Dashboard

 Market cap, holder count, burn stats

 Token launch leaderboard (trending / newest)

 Live chain activity stream (via subgraphs or RPC polling)

🧠 Phase 4: Social Tools & Distribution (~2–3 Weeks)
Goal: Make launches viral and engaging through Tweet-to-Mint and social incentives

 OAuth via Twitter API

 Tweet ownership verification

 Airdrop logic: verify retweet + wallet linked → auto drop

 Tweet-to-Mint: create a token via tweet input

 Optional “Launch with AI Art” button

🚨 Phase 5: Security & Launch Preparation (~1 Week)
 Smart contract audit (third-party or audit badge schema)

 Rate limits + security for API

 Error handling across chains

 UX polish & responsiveness (mobile + tablet)

 Final testnet stress tests

 Launch waitlist or early access system

🌍 Phase 6: Public Launch (TBD)
 Announce on X + web3 channels

 Product Hunt + Farcaster launch

 Partnership with launchpad influencers

 Leaderboard of trending tokens

 Feedback loop & bug bounty program
