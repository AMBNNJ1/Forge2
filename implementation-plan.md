# Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step strategy to implement the features described in the README.

## 1. Cleanup and Preparation
- Remove deprecated or unused files to keep the repository lean. `styles/` and `blockhain.md` were removed as they were no longer referenced.
- Ensure dependencies install and tests run (`pnpm install && pnpm test`).

## 2. Token Proposal Workflow
Based on the README's core feature list where users submit token ideas with name, symbol, tokenomics and chain preference【F:README.md†L5-L17】:
- Build a form component that captures token details and uploads an optional image.
- Store proposals in a backend service or database (e.g., Supabase).
- Mark new proposals with the status **In funding phase** until liquidity targets are reached.

## 3. Community Investment Pool
Following the README description of pooled funding and automatic launch when the threshold is met【F:README.md†L19-L30】:
- Implement wallet connection for MetaMask and Phantom.
- Allow users to deposit ETH or SOL and track contributions.
- Display a funding progress bar with countdown to target.
- Trigger deployment automatically once the liquidity goal is met.

## 4. Social Sharing Integration
As outlined in the README's social sharing section【F:README.md†L32-L39】:
- Provide a "Back this token" button that generates a pre-filled tweet.
- Create shareable links with optional referral IDs.
- Show a preview card summarizing the token.

## 5. Token Deployment Engine
Using Solidity for Base and Anchor for Solana as mentioned in the README【F:README.md†L41-L54】:
- Compile and deploy ERC‑20 or SPL tokens when funding conditions are satisfied.
- Include verified contract metadata.
- Lock liquidity for a configurable duration with options to renew.

## 6. Anti‑Rug Measures
Following the README's security features【F:README.md†L56-L71】:
- Offer optional ownership renouncement for creators.
- Display a visible liquidity lock timer on each token page.
- Allow projects to attach audit reports or security scores.
- Implement automatic refunds if funding goals are not met within the presale period.

## 7. Dashboard & Token Discovery
As described in the README's dashboard section【F:README.md†L73-L78】:
- List trending or incoming tokens with filters by chain and funding status.
- Provide a leaderboard for the most funded and most shared projects.

## 8. Technical Infrastructure
Referencing the technical stack in the README【F:README.md†L80-L88】:
- Use Next.js and Tailwind for the frontend.
- Implement API routes for backend operations.
- Interact with Alchemy and Helius RPC endpoints for blockchain access.
- Integrate token bridging via Axelar, LayerZero, or Wormhole.

## 9. Security & Deployment
Taking cues from the security considerations and milestones【F:README.md†L114-L129】:
- Run audits on smart contracts before mainnet deployment.
- Require wallet signatures for funding actions.
- Set funding caps to prevent spoofed overfunding.
- Follow the milestone schedule for building out features, starting with token proposal UI and funding mechanism.
