Set up environment

Install a wallet or key management tool for each network.

Obtain RPC URLs for Solana, Base (an EVM chain), and Avalanche.

Solana integration

Use Solana’s CLI (solana-keygen, solana config set) to create accounts and connect to an RPC endpoint.

Deploy SPL tokens or custom programs using Anchor or Solana’s SDK.

Base and Avalanche integration (EVM-based)

Configure an Ethereum development framework like Hardhat or Foundry with RPC URLs for Base and Avalanche.

Write or reuse standard ERC‑20 token contracts and deploy them using the chosen framework.

Integrate into the application

Connect wallet libraries (for example, @solana/web3.js for Solana and ethers.js for EVM chains).

For Forge’s UI, ensure that the selected chain in the “Select Blockchain” step maps to the appropriate deployment scripts or API endpoints.

Security and testing

Verify contracts via each chain’s explorer (Solana Explorer, BaseScan, SnowTrace).

Implement audits, testnet deployments, and transaction signing to secure token launches.

The repository lays the foundation with a UI that prompts for Solana, Base, or Avalanche, and the README confirms these blockchains are the intended targets for deployment. However, the low-level integration steps—such as connecting to RPC endpoints, compiling smart contracts, or handling transaction signing—would need to be implemented separately using the respective toolchains for Solana (SPL/Anchor) and EVM chains (Solidity/Hardhat).
